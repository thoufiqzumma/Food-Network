            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to
                experience. . I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to
                listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel
                the
                music
                flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean</p><br><br><br>

            <p>Median prices range from $7.25 to as much as $15. Even though we looked only at plain cheese pizza, there
                are subtle stylistic differences that likely lead to price variation. The neighborhood family-friendly
                pizza place and the typical franchise have much lower prices than artisanal wood-fire pizzerias</p>
